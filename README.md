> Finally, I can bookmark pdf's in my browser!


## About The Project

This free and open source Chrome extension is a lightweight application, that allows you to save bookmarks of pdf files
on your local machine or on the web.
There are no limits on how many bookmarks you can save. 

## Installation instructions 

No installation is required. This extension uses pure Html/Javascript/Css. No additional libraries are needed.

## Project Structure Overview

This project uses a MVC architecture. Each is represented as a file in [the javascript directory](./js)

## Usage Guide

Click on the extensions icon on the top right of your browser (Or pin the extension). 

If you move a locally saved file to a different directory or rename it, you can change the url that is associated with your bookmarks,
in order to not lose them. Simply click on the blue highlighted url field in the 'view all' mode.
A file will only be recognized as a pdf, if it ends with .pdf or .pdf#... .

You will see all your bookmarks
from your currently opened pdf file. If you have not opened a pdf file, you will see all your bookmarks grouped by file.
You can add as many bookmarks as you want. The delete all option will either delete all of your bookmarks from the currently opened
pdf (If you are in the 'current pdf' view) or all bookmarks saved in your storage (If you are on the 'show all bookmarks' view).
If you click on a bookmark field, the pdf will open in a new tab at the specified page. You can change the page, by changing the page
input besides your bookmark.
